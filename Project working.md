### Setting up Ultradistopia
1. Connect ardunio UNO to the computer.
2. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the microprocessor -> [[circuit.png]]
3. Load [[DistanceMeasurement.ino]] in Ardunio IDE and upload it to the microprocessor.
4. Open [[DistanceMeasurement.m]] in MATLAB.
5. Make sure the GUI figures are in the same folder as the MATLAB code.
6. Run the MATLAB code.
7. Move an object or hand in-front of the ultrasonic sensor to measure various distances.
